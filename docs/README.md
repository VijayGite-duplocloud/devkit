# Documentation

Everything beyond the [README](../README.md). Start at the top and work down — the order is the path a new
reader takes.

| Page | What it covers |
| --- | --- |
| [quickstart.md](quickstart.md) | The fast path: a running platform with AWS connected |
| [getting-started/](getting-started/README.md) | The full guided path — prerequisites, install, AWS, Kubernetes, and your first extension |
| [architecture.md](architecture.md) | How the studio, agent, UI, xterm, and Mongo fit together, and how the hot-load loop works |
| [configuration.md](configuration.md) | Every `.env` variable — default, effect, and which are managed for you |
| [cli-reference.md](cli-reference.md) | `run.sh`, `stop.sh`, `logs.sh`, and every script in `scripts/` — flags and behavior |
| [upgrading.md](upgrading.md) | Taking framework updates, and how image-tag pinning works |
| [troubleshooting.md](troubleshooting.md) | Symptoms, causes, fixes |
| [faq.md](faq.md) | Licensing, data, platform support, and what happens on upgrade |
| [UPGRADING-ng-common-lib.md](UPGRADING-ng-common-lib.md) | Refreshing the vendored `@duplocloud-internal/ng-common-lib` tarball |

## Writing extensions

The authoring manual is the 20 numbered guides in
[`.claude/skills/duplo-extension-dev/reference/`](../.claude/skills/duplo-extension-dev/reference) —
naming, architecture, the authoring path, base classes, hooks, custom actions, registration, scope
credentials, parent/child and menus, the SDK API, deprovisioning, enrichment and live state, current user,
forms and wizards, error handling, opt-in Ask AI sessions, the hand-written result content, access control,
and the detail-page shell. They are the source of truth, and the `/duplo-extension` authoring command reads
them directly.

Worked examples live in [`samples/`](../samples) — start with
[`samples/helloworld`](../samples/helloworld), the reference sample.
