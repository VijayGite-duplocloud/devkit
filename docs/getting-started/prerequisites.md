# 0. Prerequisites

**What you'll do:** Confirm you have what this kit needs — Docker with Compose v2, Python 3, LLM access,
a verified email address, and five free ports.

**What you need first:** Nothing. This is the first page.

The dev kit runs the whole platform from published images. There is no *language* toolchain to install —
no .NET, no Node: every container it starts, and every extension you later build, is built and run inside
Docker. The two things that must exist on the host are Docker itself and `python3`, which the setup
scripts use as their JSON and `.env` editor.

---

## 0.1 Docker, with Compose v2

Docker Desktop, Colima, Rancher Desktop, or a plain Docker Engine all work. What matters is that the
daemon is running and that `docker compose` (two words, the v2 plugin) exists.

1. Check both at once.

   ```bash
   docker --version && docker compose version
   ```

   You should see:

   ```
   Docker version 29.6.1, build 8900f1d
   Docker Compose version v5.2.0
   ```

   Any Compose `v2.x` or newer is fine. If the second line does not print, you have Compose v1 only and
   need the v2 plugin.

## 0.2 Python 3

`run.sh` and everything under `scripts/` shell out to `python3` to rewrite `.env` safely (tokens and keys
contain characters that break `sed`) and to read JSON out of the platform's API. Only the standard
library is used — no `pip install`, no virtualenv, no version floor beyond "it is called `python3`".

```bash
python3 --version
```

macOS ships one with the Xcode command line tools (`xcode-select --install`) or `brew install python3`;
Debian/Ubuntu, `sudo apt-get install -y python3`; RHEL/Amazon Linux, `sudo dnf install -y python3`.

`./run.sh` checks for this and for Docker before it does anything else, and names whatever is missing.

## 0.3 LLM access

The agent needs a model to call. Pick one before you start — `./run.sh` asks for it and will not finish
without LLM access. On an EC2 instance whose role can invoke Bedrock, `./run.sh` offers that role and no
keys are needed.

| Provider | What you need | Where `./run.sh` puts it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Anthropic** (simplest) | An API key, `sk-ant-…` | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` |
| **AWS Bedrock** | `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` + `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` (+ `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN` if they are temporary), and a region with Claude enabled | `AWS_*` |
| **LLM gateway** (OpenRouter, Bifrost, LiteLLM, Snowflake Cortex, …) | The gateway's base URL, its API key / token if it needs one, and the model name as the gateway lists it | `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`, `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`, `CLAUDE_MODEL` |

Those three are the choices in `./run.sh`'s menu. Azure AI Foundry also works, but is configured by hand in
`.env` rather than offered by the prompt. Precedence when more than one is set is
`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` → gateway → Azure → Bedrock — see
[configuration.md](../configuration.md#llm-provider).

## 0.4 An email address you can read

Setup requires a **verified email address**. `./run.sh` asks for one, DuploCloud emails you a
verification link, and the run waits for you to click it before carrying on. So:

- **Use an address you can read right now.** The install blocks until that email arrives and you click
  the link.
- **Work or personal is fine.** Privacy-relay and disposable domains are not accepted — you get
  `Re-run with --email <addr> — most work and personal addresses are accepted; privacy-relay and disposable
  domains are not.` and a chance to retype.

The same address becomes your portal login on the next page.

## 0.5 Free ports

The kit binds five host ports. They are deliberately offset from the platform's standard ports so this kit
can run *alongside* a full local DuploCloud platform.

| Port | Service |
| --- | --- |
| `4210` | Portal UI — `http://localhost:4210` |
| `60031` | Studio API — `http://localhost:60031` |
| `8010` | `claude-code-agent` |
| `27018` | MongoDB |
| `6061` | In-browser terminal (xterm) |

If something on your machine already holds one of them, you do not need to free it — change the matching
`*_PORT` in `.env` on the next page instead. The variables, and the trap in *blanking* one rather than
changing it, are in [configuration.md](../configuration.md#host-ports).
