#   ./run.sh                       first run prompts for email and requests a trial license. You are emailed
#                                  a verification link: click it and the license is issued and picked up
#                                  automatically (this run waits up to 2 minutes for it). Then it prompts
#                                  for password/LLM provider and starts everything; later runs are
#                                  silent (no prompts). They also adopt any changed framework defaults
#                                  (image tags/platform) from .env.example, keeping your overrides.
#   ./run.sh --reset               wipe the DB + all configured values (incl. provider credentials) and
#                                  start fresh. This is the ONLY thing that clears credentials from .env —
#                                  normal restarts never touch them; use --reset to switch providers cleanly.
#                                  Your license is left alone: it is not stack state, and DuploCloud issues
#                                  exactly ONE per email address, so there is nothing to gain by discarding it.
#   ./run.sh --reset-license       forget the license too (the JWT and the ids it can be re-fetched from).
#                                  Prints the JWT first: DuploCloud will NOT issue a second one for this
#                                  address. Restore it with --license <jwt>, or let a later run recover it —
#                                  it asks the server to email you a link that releases the same license.
#                                  Combine with --reset, or use alone to re-license (with --license, or a
#                                  new --email).
#   ./run.sh --license <jwt>       use a license JWT you already have (no licensing call is made).
#   ./run.sh --email <addr>        set/correct the admin email. While a license request is still unverified
#                                  this also replaces it: the saved request id can only verify the address it
#                                  was made for, so a new address drops it and requests again. That is how you
#                                  get out of a mistyped email whose verification link you never received.

#            the `docker compose` subcommand — the standalone `docker-compose` v1 binary is not used.

# The dev kit is licensed. The trial license is issued to the admin email above (the company
# is derived from its domain) and stored as Licensing__Token, which the studio container reads
# through docker-compose's env_file (→ Licensing:Token). ONE trial per email address: if the server says it
# already issued one, we recover that license rather than asking for anything — the server emails the
# licensee a link, and clicking it releases the same token to this dev kit.
# The license server verifies the address before it issues anything: the POST returns a trial id and an
# email goes out, and the license only exists once the recipient clicks the link. We save that id as
# LICENSE_TRIAL_UUID (and a recovery's id as LICENSE_RECOVERY_UUID) and poll it, so an interrupted or
# timed-out run resumes instead of starting over — re-requesting is not an option, the second POST just
# takes the already-issued 400.
# The license server is a built-in default, not a shipped .env key — the studio defaults to the same host
# on its side. Setting LICENSE_API_URL in .env still overrides it, for when DuploCloud says to point
